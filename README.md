# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project is developed as part of a hackathon conducted by Google Developer Group (GDG) On Campus.

## Problem Statement
Fake news spreads rapidly on digital platforms and can mislead people. This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake using machine learning.

## Solution
A machine learning model is trained using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression to analyze news text and predict its authenticity.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. Enter news text to get prediction (Real/Fake)

## Future Scope
- Improve accuracy using larger datasets
- Deploy as a web application using Google technologies
